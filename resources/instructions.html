    <p>To get this assessment started, you should go and grab the
        <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/introduction-to-html/marking-up-a-letter-start/letter-text.txt"
            class="external" rel="noopener">raw text you need to mark up</a>, and the

            rel="noopener">CSS you need to include</a> in your HTML. Create a new
        <code>.html</code> file using your text editor to do your work in.</p>

    <h2 id="Project_brief">Project brief</h2>

    <p>For this project, your task is to mark up a letter that needs to be hosted on a university intranet. The letter is a
        response from a research fellow to a prospective PhD student concerning their application to work at the university.</p>

    <p>Block/structural semantics:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>You should structure the overall document with an appropriate structure including doctype, and
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html" target="_blank" title="The HTML &lt;html> element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root element. All other elements must be descendants of this element.">
                <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>
            </a>,
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head" target="_blank" title="The HTML &lt;head> element provides general information (metadata) about the document, including its title and links to its scripts and style sheets.">
                <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
            </a> and
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body" target="_blank" title="The HTML &lt;body> Element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one &lt;body> element in a document.">
                <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>
            </a> elements.</li>
        <li>The letter in general should be marked up with a structure of paragraphs and headings, with the exception of the
            below points. There is one top level heading (the "Re:" line) and three second level headings.</li>
        <li>The semester start dates, study subjects and exotic dances should be marked up using an appropriate list type.</li>
        <li>The two addresses can just be put inside paragraphs. The
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/address" target="_blank" title="The HTML &lt;address> element indicates that the enclosed HTML provides contact information for a person or people, or for an organization.">
                <code>&lt;address&gt;</code>
            </a> element is not appropriate for them — think about why. In addition, each line of the addresses should sit
            on a new line, but not be in a new paragraph.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Inline semantics:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The names of the sender and receiver (and "Tel" and "Email") should be marked up with strong importance.</li>
        <li>The four dates in the document should be given appropriate elements containing machine-readable dates.</li>
        <li>The first address and first date in the letter should be given a class attribute value of "sender-column"; the CSS
            you'll add later will then cause these to be right aligned, as should be the case in a classic letter layout.</li>
        <li>The five acronyms/abbreviations in the main text of the letter should be marked up to provide expansions of each
            acronym/abbreviation.
        </li>
        <li>The six sub/superscripts should be marked up appropriately — in the chemical formulae, and the numbers 103 and 104
            (they should be 10 to the power or 3 and 4, respectively).</li>
        <li>The degree symbols and multiply symbols should be marked up using
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references" class="external" rel="noopener">appropriate entity references</a>.</li>
        <li>Try to mark up at least two appropriate words in the text with strong importance/emphasis.</li>
        <li>There are two places where a hyperlink should be added; add appropriate links with titles. For the location that
            the links point to, just use http://example.com.</li>
        <li>The university motto quote and citation should be marked up with appropriate elements.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The head of the document:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The character set of the document should be specified as utf-8 using an appropriate meta tag.</li>
        <li>The author of the letter should be specified in an appropriate meta tag.</li>
        <li>The provided CSS should be included inside an appropriate tag.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Hints_and_tips">Hints and tips</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Use the
            <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" class="external" rel="noopener">W3C HTML validator</a> to validate your HTML; you'll get bonus points if it validates.</li>
        <li>You don't need to know any CSS to do this assessment; you just need to put the provided CSS inside an HTML element.</li>
    </ul>
